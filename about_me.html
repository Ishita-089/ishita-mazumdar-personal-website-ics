        Hey! I’m Ishita, a first-year student at Ashoka University, majoring in Biology and figuring out whether I want to minor in Computer Science or Chemistry (or both, if chaos permits). I’m interested in how living systems work—from the elegance of molecular pathways to the messiness of evolution—and I love asking big, weird questions that blend science, logic, and the occasional existential crisis.

I’m especially drawn to where biology meets technology. Lately, I’ve been diving into functional programming, rational number algorithms, and thinking about how computational tools can help us understand things like gene expression or drug interactions. I’ve also got a soft spot for clinical trials, nanomedicine, and the philosophy of science.

Outside of classes, I tend to collect odd fascinations: morbid trivia, rock music that sounds like it was written by haunted poets, and unhinged ideas that involve interpretive dance or taxidermy (don’t ask). I read literature that hurts in a good way, code things that may or may not work, and occasionally get too emotionally invested in scientific debates. I'm also into science communication and making academic spaces more humane, funny, and curious. 
If you're into biology, indie playlists that match literary themes, chaotic intellectual energy, or just want to talk we'll definitely get along.
